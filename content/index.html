      <p>During the workshop the assistants will understand the motivations to create your own tools and how fun it can be. Examples would be provided of some tools I’ve developed through the years to help me work better. Automating git workflows, several useful rails tasks, a command line tool to use “Redmine” and also some examples on how to automate the use of gitorious and/or other sites using tools like “Mechanize”, “Httparty”, etc.</p>
      <p>The idea is that after the workshop, the assistants will see all the opportunities that the shell has to offer to us and how it can help us become better programmers. We should not just take tools for granted and as something we merely use but we should create our own tools and see it as an opportunity to improve our abilities as craftsmen. Like painters create their own colors to make their beautiful paints, we should create our own tools to help us create that beautiful code we all love.</p>

      <p>Relational databases are great when you have a well defined, consistent and pre-designed set of data or at least you have the possibility of changing it at your will.</p>
      <p>In other words, when you are Ed Harris in “The Truman Show” and you can manage all the characters in your play and all the relationships among them to achieve the behaviour you need. But your web application is probably not a close ecosystem anymore; you are probably harnessing the power of the cloud using data from a third party, or you want to combine it with data comming from other sources, like a legacy CRM, which probably don’t fit in the schema you had prepared for them.</p>
      <p>Replication and data decentralization is another issue that presents non-trivial challenges in relational databases. For example, as mobile devices become more popular, you may want to have part of your application work in those devices with the security that everything will be synchronized correctly.</p>
      <p>CouchDB is a non-relational Document Oriented Database that promisses to solve all these problems. It allows you to store a relatively large amount of unstructured data emphasizing in scalability, consistency and replication, in exchange of some performance punishment, all told.</p>
      <p>In this talk we will give an overview of CouchDB and the alternatives to integrate it with our Rails application and explain scenarios when we might need it. We will also show a real use case where we combine web server access logs, live video-streaming server logs and tweets to determine in real time what’s hot and what’s not during a live streamed interview.</p>

      <p>Esti Álvarez is software developer and partner at eFaber, an open source based technology consulting company that is proudly turning 10 years old in 2010.</p>
      <p>eFaber’s activity consist mainly of developing web applications with Ruby on Rails and being updated of new technologies that come up, that’s why they are now using CouchDB and digging into the world of mobile applications development, among another hundreds of things.</p>
      <p>When she’s not working, she’s usually either taking pictures, hacking, exercising at the gym or tweeting as @esti</p>
      <p>In her previous life she was a physicist, who played with Christallography and X-Ray diffraction, so she can safely be called an “intruder” in the Meneame slang ;-)</p>

      <p>This is a talk about documentation, why is it important, why is it hard, we’ll discuss some myths and reflect about this topic.</p>
      <p>Ruby is a very dynamic language, this complicates things quite a bit, we’ll see specific issues depicted with examples from the Rails API.</p>
      <p>We’ll also explain what is docrails, what’s going on in this aspect of the Rails project, ideas for the future, and how people can contribute to the Rails documentation.</p>
      <span class="conf-lecturer">Xavier Noria</span>
      <p>He spends most of his spare time working in Open Source projects, writing code, docs, helping in mailing lists or IRC, etc.</p>
      <p>He has been into Perl for some years and is a CPAN author, former leader of Barcelona.pm, and teach a Perl semester at the University of Barcelona.</p>
      <p>He has been around Rails since 2005 and is a Rails committer, member of the Rails Documentation Team, and the guy behind Rails Contributors.</p>
      <p>Also honored to have been presented a Ruby Hero Award in RailsConf 2010, held in Baltimore, and to be the president of the Spanish Ruby Users Group, which organised the European Ruby Conference 2009 (EuRuKo 2009), held in Barcelona.</p>
