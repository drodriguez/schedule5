              <span class="conf-title">Compass and the 960 framework</span>
              <span class="subsection">Purpose</span>
<p>CSS frameworks are great but they have disadvantages like the use of
a non semantic naming-scheme in the markup. This problem and many others
can be solved with SASS and Compass. The Compass community is growing.
The first goal of this workshop is to feel comfortable with Compass and
SASS and learn to use battle tested styles and mixins in our
stylesheets. The second goal is to encourage the assistants to use this
knowledge on their real life projects and join the community.</p>
<span class="subsection">Abstract</span>
<p>The first aproach of this workshop is to give a short introduction to
SASS, 960 and Compass. The main point of the introduction is the
understanding of the different pieces and how they work together, so
that we can get our hands dirty ASAP. The duration of the introduction
will depend on the experience of the attendes, but I guess it will take
around 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The next hour we will be doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install and configure Compass and 960 in a previously given demo
  app.</li>
  <li>Starting from a given simple design in Photoshop, we´ll do a
  simple markup in HAML. (I may skip this step and give the
  solutions)</li>
  <li>Place correctly the components using our stylesheets and the
  960 framework.</li>
  <li>Use of the SASS Power (import, mixins(functions) and variables) to
  get DRY and mantainable code in our stylesheets</li>
  <li>We´ll use different Compass mixins for CSS3. (borders, shadows,
  color gradients,…)</li>
  <li>Depending on the time we have, we will try different cool Compass
  mixins: Fancy-buttons, Sticky-footer, Sprites,…</li>
</ul>

              <span class="subsection">Description</span>
<p>This original and experiential workshop is a journey through the
principles of improvisational acting and its real-world life-changing
applications. See, practice and understand how to become a better team
member by learning to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hone your listening skills</li>
  <li>Embrace changes</li>
  <li>Express your ideas without worring about your inner critic</li>
  <li>Create an open and creative environment</li>
  <li>Bring humor to your work</li>
</ul>
<p>Join us to find out why improv is becoming the hottest trend in the
business!</p>
<span class="subsection">Why this topic</span>
<p>When you stop to think about it, working with Ruby on Rails is a lot
like improv acting:</p>
<p>Teamwork and collaboration stand at the base. Being able to bounce
ideas from one head to another is a must, as well as being open to
change. Creativity is key.</p>
<p>By learning and practicing some improv acting exercises – and with
the right briefing and debriefing – developers can better understand and
improve the essential skills for productive collaboration.</p>
<p>The unlikely marriage of improv training and Ruby on Rail already
proved itself to be extremely successful and beneficial in international
conferences and businesses. This workshop is perfect for Conferencia
Rails.</p>

              <p>During the workshop the assistants will understand the motivations to
create your own tools and how fun it can be. Examples would be provided
of some tools I’ve developed through the years to help me work better.
Automating git workflows, several useful rails tasks, a command line
tool to use “Redmine” and also some examples on how to automate the use
of gitorious and/or other sites using tools like “Mechanize”,
“Httparty”, etc.</p>
<p>The idea is that after the workshop, the assistants will see all the
opportunities that the shell has to offer to us and how it can help us
become better programmers. We should not just take tools for granted and
as something we merely use but we should create our own tools and see it
as an opportunity to improve our abilities as craftsmen. Like painters
create their own colors to make their beautiful paints, we should create
our own tools to help us create that beautiful code we all love.</p>

              <span class="subsection">What it is a rejected talk, anyway?</span>
<p>People behind the official conference have the difficult task of
putting together a program choosing between many great proposals. As a
result, some of them, unfortunately, get rejected.</p>
<p>But those aren't the only rejected talks. There are many others. Some
of them only existed in your mind and you personally took care of
rejecting them before anyone would ever know. Or maybe you mentioned
your idea to some colleagues and friends but you didn't like their faces
and knew that it wasn't worth sending the proposal.</p>
<p>RejectConf is the place for all those talks which didn't make it.
Those undiscovered gems that someone (probably you) considered too
boring or too wild or too uninteresting or too … So, be brave and add
that crazy talk of yours to the list below. You won't be rejected here.
Here, we celebrate rejection!</p>

              <p>Dexy is a new approach to documenting your software. Dexy is a build
tool for documents, inspired by Knuth’s concept of literate
programming, but with a fresh implementation and a very powerful set of
features to let you write documentation in any language and for any
tool. With Dexy, the example code and the example output in your
documentation all come from running live code, so you can write
documentation quickly, maintain it easily, and your documentation
becomes another way of testing your software.</p>
<p>In this talk I will introduce Dexy and discuss how it can be used for
documenting Rails project, from documenting the source code to
automating screenshots of the finished product. While Dexy happens to be
written in Python, it is usable for any language including Ruby, with
the advantage that you can use Dexy to document your polyglot projects.
Your JavaScript, Java or C code does not need to be a second-class
citizen in your project documentation.</p>
<p>Dexy will help you improve the quality of your code, make it painless
and fun to write awesome documentation, and help you promote (or sell!)
your project by writing helpful tutorials and user guides.</p>

              <p>We live in a globalised world where companies have to sell their
products and services in the international market to make the most of
their investments of time, money and resources. Especially with the
current economic situation, companies of all industries are forced to
become internationalized. Internet gives sotfware and web developers
great opportunities and advantages. The process of translating a
software or web application for different target countries or markets
needs to be done with the help of specialists. The reason for that is
that if the development team does not have experience or knowledge in
subjects like globalisation (g11n), internationalisation (i18n) and
localisation (l10n), the lack of a standarised solution could lead a
project to its failure in terms of quality of the localised versions,
poor sales or negative branding effects.</p>
<p>In this session we will talk of the need to develop applications for
the international market from day 0, with statistics showing that even
big corporations make more sales in foreign countries. Do you want to be
out of the game?</p>
<p>In the second part we will explain the main methods and tools used
nowadays to prepare ruby source code for translation and
localisation.</p>
<p>We will end our presentation with the recommended best practices of
localisation engineers, translators and testers for making the
localisation process more easy, efficient, fast and cheap for
everyone.</p>

<p>In other words, when you are Ed Harris in “The Truman Show” and you can manage all the characters in your play and all the relationships among them to achieve the behaviour you need. But your web application is probably not a close ecosystem anymore; you are probably harnessing the power of the cloud using data from a third party, or you want to combine it with data comming from other sources, like a legacy CRM, which probably don’t fit in the schema you had prepared for them.</p>
<p>Replication and data decentralization is another issue that presents non-trivial challenges in relational databases. For example, as mobile devices become more popular, you may want to have part of your application work in those devices with the security that everything will be synchronized correctly.</p>
<p>CouchDB is a non-relational Document Oriented Database that promisses to solve all these problems. It allows you to store a relatively large amount of unstructured data emphasizing in scalability, consistency and replication, in exchange of some performance punishment, all told.</p>
<p>In this talk we will give an overview of CouchDB and the alternatives to integrate it with our Rails application and explain scenarios when we might need it. We will also show a real use case where we combine web server access logs, live video-streaming server logs and tweets to determine in real time what’s hot and what’s not during a live streamed interview.</p>

<p>The outline would look like this</p>
<ul>

  development</li>
  <li>Introduce node.js and why it’s causing a stir</li>
  <li>Introduce eventmachine</li>

<p>I have been coding since the days of C64 and then slowly migrating up
the stack of abstraction to those high level languages we have all come
to love. Recently I find myself migrating down the stack again towards
the machine when I got fascinated by evented programming using node.js
and ruby.</p>
<p>I’m currently team lead for Xing’s Spanish office based in Barcelona
and when I’m not doing managerial stuff I’m digging into ideas around
optimizing our application platform. I have also published a mongodb
driver for node.js and I’m currently trying my hand at writing a
distributed file system in google go. Before this I got a ton of years
behind me doing ruby, java, erlang etc.</p>

              <p>Our presentation will at first briefly explain Cucumber for attendees
new to Cucumber. Then we will explain two use cases of Cucumber outside
Rails. One will cover lessons learnt while using Cucumber for Smoke
testing an enterprise Java application. This Java application provisions
broadband and telephone services, such as Telefonica in Spain (Alan
Kennedy). The second part of the presentation will be on how to use
Cucumber to test iPhone applications with iCuke (Borja Arias).</p>
<p>The part that covers Smoke testing an enterprise Java application
will cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to smoke testing</li>
  <li>Example of an application to apply this concept (this example will
  be used throughout the rest of this part of the presentation)</li>
  <li>How to structure the project</li>
  <li>Defining your testing domain model and using it in your step
  definitions</li>
  <li>Testing the domain model</li>
  <li>Using the classes extracted from the domain model to write
  enhanced Cucumber reports</li>
  <li>Integrating with Java by using Jruby to avoid duplication of data
  and test setup</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part on integration testing using iCuke (Cucumber for the
iPhone) will cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to iCuke and how it works</li>
  <li>Recorded demo video showing the available steps and how to use
  them</li>
  <li>Pros and Cons</li>
  <li>Extending iCuke (with regards to one of the cons)</li>
  <li>Alternatives (Brief comparative with Apple UIAutomation)</li>

<span class="conf-lecturer">Alan Kennedy</span>
<p>I’ve loved Ruby on Rails since I first tried it out in 2007, mostly
because it allows quick feedback, both for the developer and the
client/user. I believe that working in an Agile team, as we do at
Unboxed Consulting, minimises risks. Agile practices allow the team to
adapt to changes that clients may want and they also encourage close
communication with the client early on in the project.</p>
<span class="conf-lecturer">Borja Arias</span>
<p>I enjoy seeking and developing solutions to programming problems.
Working at Unboxed you find yourself in the middle of a continuous flow
of ideas, which is great for the creative process. In my spare time I
can be seen playing basketball or running at night in the streets of
London.</p>

              <p>You probably follow the motto “skinny controller, fat model”, which
is a good thing. Skinny controllers are definitely the way to go but, as
your domain logic grows, it’s very easy to end up with a model
overweight problem, which is not so good. The issue is that your
ActiveRecord objects have to deal with too many different
responsibilities: validation, business rules, awareness of its own
persistence, filtering…</p>
<p>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural
pattern that promises to improve the maintainability, performance and
scalability of your applications by helping to separate concerns in your
system. This pattern, along with Event Sourcing and other Domain-Driven
Design ideas, is gaining increased popularity, particularly among
developers building solutions for rich / complex domains.</p>
<p>This talk will introduce these concepts and show different ways we
can (re)architect our Rails application in order to get their benefits.
From a simple implementation using just the “tools in the room” to a
implementation “in all its full glory” using NoSQL data stores and
messaging queues.</p>
<p>All those who have a Rails projects complex enough to abuse of model
callbacks, de-normalize the database or use presenter objects, may get
benefits in terms of simplicity and maintainability from implementing
the ideas I’ll present in this talk.</p>

              <p>Pair programming is a helpful tool for your development toolbox when
you understand how it works and what are the benefits. We’ll address
common misconceptions of managers (“Two people sitting at one desk?
That’s going to cost twice as much!”) and how to assuage these concerns.
We will delve into the common fears of developers (“I won’t be able to
get into ‘The Zone’”, “I can’t read RSS.”, “They find out I’m not a good
developer.”). We’ll examine numerous configurations, ergonomics, and
available tools for both co-located and geographically distributed
teams. Finally, we’ll wrap up with a discussion on the utility of
pairing mixed skill peoples together (Designer/Developer, Blind/Deaf,
Cat/Dog) to acheive a result that is more than the sum of its parts.</p>

              <p>From neo4j website:</p>
<p>“Neo4j is a graph database. It is an embedded, disk-based, fully
transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in
graphs rather than in tables. A graph (mathematical lingo for a network)
is a flexible data structure that allows a more agile and rapid style of
development.”</p>
<p>Neo4j allows you to map objects to nodes and relations, that is a
more natural fit than mapping them to relational tables.</p>
<p>Modeling with elements of a graph is substantially faster for semi
structured data (Recall that semi structured data is data that has few
mandatory but many optional attributes).</p>
<p>Neo4j is a powerful graph database/engine that every rails developer
should know.</p>
<p>In this talk we will cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An overview of the technology of graph databases (particularly
  neo4j database)</li>
  <li>How to model your world with nodes, relationships and
  properties.</li>
  <li>How to use neo4j with jruby, neo4j-rails for ruby on rails and
  neo4j-rest JSON REST API/</li>
  <li>Implement simple functionality for your social network site:
  members degrees of separation, connection path between two members,
  members you should know.</li>

              <p>This is a talk about documentation, why is it important, why is it
hard, we’ll discuss some myths and reflect about this topic.</p>
<p>Ruby is a very dynamic language, this complicates things quite a bit,
we’ll see specific issues depicted with examples from the Rails API.</p>
<p>We’ll also explain what is docrails, what’s going on in this aspect
of the Rails project, ideas for the future, and how people can
contribute to the Rails documentation.</p>

              <span class="conf-title">Simple data visualization with JS</span>
              <p>Creating useful and usable visual representation of a set of data is
in general a difficult task involving knowledge of math, programming and
probably some statistics and design.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on the web there are many situations where we only need
a simple chart to represent our data. When this is the case we can use
any of the plenty of JavaScript libraries available out there for
rendering numerical data into interactive visualization.</p>
<p>In this talk we will see how to use two of these libraries, Raphaël
and ProtoVis to convert a table with numbers into interactive chart.
Both libraries use a SVG object to represent the data but differ in the
way this object is created.</p>

<p>I am working as a web developer since more than 12 years ago. I have
started with PHP/FI then I have worked with Perl and after joining the
eFaber team I have been developing web applications using openACS and
Ruby on Rails.</p>

              <span class="conf-title">Rails is not enough</span>
              <p>We rails people tend to think of Rails as the center-piece of web
development. The same thing can be said of .net, Spring/Java Server
Faces, Drupal, Python or name-your-web-framework-of-choice-here
people.</p>
<p>Web frameworks are just a component of web applications, and if you
want to succeed you better know the miriads of other components beyond
your rockstar code.</p>
<p>In my session I will talk about things you must take into account and
tools/techniques you should master if you want to make a difference in
web development.</p>
<span class="conf-lecturer">Javier Ramirez</span>
<p>Since 1995 I’ve been earning my salt in software development, doing
this and that in different places, industries and companies, including a
small java-centric shop I co-founded —and then cowardly left— some years
ago.</p>
<p>Along these years I’ve delivered training on things like Robotics,
Software Engineering, JAVA, PHP and Ruby on Rails. I have also
participated in several workshops and conferences talking about Ruby on
Rails, plug-in and games programming, XML processing, CSS frameworks,
SEO or agile development.</p>
<p>Apart from the occasional freelancing or training gig, I’m the CTO of
ASPgems, where I’ve been working since 2006 developing web projects with
Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>I’m also the author of the book “Aptana RadRails: An IDE for Rails
Development” and an active member of the local Ruby scene, being a
founding member of the Spanish Rails Conference, the Spanish Ruby Users
Group (SRUG) and madrid-rb, the Ruby users group in Madrid. Lately I can
be seen also on the Agile Madrid group activities.</p>
